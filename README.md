# routing_test_app

This is an example Flutter application using the the Navigator 2.0 api with the Provider package for state management. Navigation logic is encapsulated in the NavigationManager class, which is made available to widgets in the widget tree through Provider. Widgets call into NavigationManager to push or pop certain screens from the page route.
